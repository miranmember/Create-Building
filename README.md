# Create-Building-C-
This C++ program allows users to display an ASCII art graphic of a building. The user is presented with a menu of options, including the ability to display the original graphic, display a building with a user-specified number of sections, or exit the program. The program also includes error handling for invalid menu options and user input for the number of building sections. This project could potentially be useful for anyone interested in ASCII art or practicing their C++ skills.
